Comparison of Spring Integration and Spring Batch
Spring Integration
Pros:

Event-Driven: Spring Integration is designed for real-time, event-driven processing. It is ideal for workflows where tasks are triggered by events (e.g., file arrival, message reception).
Modular and Flexible: Offers a wide range of adapters for various protocols and systems (e.g., SFTP, Kafka, HTTP).
Asynchronous Processing: Easily supports asynchronous processing and real-time data flow between components.
Cons:

Complexity: Can become complex for workflows that require extensive error handling and retry logic.
State Management: Not inherently designed for long-running batch jobs with complex state management.
Spring Batch
Pros:

Batch Processing: Specifically designed for batch processing, with robust support for chunk-based processing, transaction management, and restartability.
Error Handling and Retry: Built-in mechanisms for handling errors, retries, and skip logic.
State Management: Excellent support for managing the state of long-running jobs, making it easy to track job progress and resume failed jobs.
Cons:

Not Real-Time: Primarily designed for scheduled batch jobs, not real-time event-driven processing.
Complex Setup: Can be more complex to set up for workflows that are inherently event-driven.
Conclusion
Use Spring Integration if:

You need real-time, event-driven processing.
Your workflow involves asynchronous communication between components.
You require modular and flexible integration
