When you run a Java application that connects to the TIBCO Mailbox server using SSH, you still need to handle SSH authentication to ensure secure communication between your application and the TIBCO Mailbox server. This typically involves verifying the server's host key to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and using an appropriate authentication method (e.g., public key authentication) for the client.

Why Host Key Verification is Important
Security: Verifying the server's host key ensures that your Java application is connecting to the legitimate TIBCO Mailbox server and not an imposter. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept and potentially alter the data being transferred.
Trust: By storing and verifying the server's host key, your application can trust the server it is connecting to, ensuring the integrity of the connection.
Steps for SSH Authentication in Java with JSch
Here are the typical steps for setting up SSH authentication in a Java application using the JSch library:

Server Authentication using Host Key: Verify the server's host key against the known hosts stored in your application or system.
User Authentication: Authenticate the client using public key authentication or another method (e.g., password).


The primary purpose of host key verification is to ensure that the client is connecting to the intended server and not to an imposter. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker might intercept and alter the communication between the client and the server.

Summary
Client Responsibility: The client is responsible for verifying the serverâ€™s host key to ensure it is connecting to the correct server. This is done by checking the server's presented host key against the known host keys stored in the client's HostKeyRepository.
Security: Adding the server's host key to the client's repository (jsch.getHostKeyRepository().add(hostKey, null);) is crucial for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring secure communication.
Configuration: Setting StrictHostKeyChecking to yes enhances security by ensuring that the client only connects to servers whose keys are explicitly trusted.
