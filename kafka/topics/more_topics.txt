When deciding between using more topics (one per application) and shared topics (several applications sharing a topic), it's important to consider the implications for stream joins, data calculations, analysis, and the overall administration and support costs. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of these factors:

### 1. Stream Joins and Data Calculations

**Option 1: More Topics (One Topic per Application)**
- **Stream Joins**:
  - **Complexity**: Joins can be simpler because each topic is dedicated to a specific application's data. There is no need to filter out unrelated data based on application identifiers.
  - **Performance**: Joins can be more efficient since the volume of data in each topic is limited to the application it serves.
- **Data Calculations**:
  - **Isolation**: Data calculations and aggregations are isolated per application, reducing the risk of errors due to mixed data.
  - **Flexibility**: Easier to manage and modify calculation logic for specific applications without impacting others.

**Option 2: Shared Topics**
- **Stream Joins**:
  - **Complexity**: Joins can become more complex because you need to filter messages by application identifiers (e.g., using headers) before performing the join operation.
  - **Performance**: There might be additional overhead due to filtering and processing unrelated messages, potentially impacting join performance.
- **Data Calculations**:
  - **Mixed Data**: Calculations can become more complex as you need to handle and filter data from multiple applications within the same topic.
  - **Risk of Errors**: Higher risk of errors in calculations due to the presence of unrelated data.

### 2. Administration and Support Costs

**Option 1: More Topics (One Topic per Application)**
- **Administration**:
  - **Higher Management Overhead**: Managing a large number of topics increases administrative tasks, such as configuring, monitoring, and scaling topics.
  - **Configuration Complexity**: More complex configurations are required for topics, partitions, and access control.
- **Support**:
  - **Higher Support Costs**: Supporting a larger number of topics can increase operational costs, including monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance.
  - **Resource Utilization**: More topics can lead to higher resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage), increasing infrastructure costs.
  - **Scalability**: Managing a high number of topics can be challenging as the number of applications grows, potentially impacting Kafka cluster scalability.

**Option 2: Shared Topics**
- **Administration**:
  - **Simplified Management**: Fewer topics mean simpler configuration, monitoring, and scaling.
  - **Easier Setup**: Initial setup and configuration are easier with fewer topics to manage.
- **Support**:
  - **Lower Support Costs**: Fewer topics reduce the operational costs related to monitoring and maintenance.
  - **Resource Efficiency**: Shared topics can lead to better resource utilization, potentially lowering infrastructure costs.
  - **Scalability**: Easier to scale Kafka infrastructure with fewer topics, but care must be taken to manage the increased volume of mixed data within shared topics.

### Summary

**Option 1: More Topics (One Topic per Application)**
- **Advantages**:
  - Simpler stream joins and data calculations due to isolated application data.
  - Easier to manage application-specific logic and changes.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Higher administrative and support costs due to a larger number of topics.
  - Increased resource utilization and complexity in managing the Kafka cluster.

**Option 2: Shared Topics**
- **Advantages**:
  - Lower administrative and support costs with fewer topics.
  - More efficient resource utilization and easier initial setup.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex stream joins and data calculations due to the need for filtering application-specific data.
  - Higher risk of errors and potential performance overhead due to mixed data within shared topics.

### Recommendations

The choice between these two options should be based on your specific requirements and priorities:

- **Choose More Topics (One Topic per Application) if**:
  - You need simplicity in stream joins and data calculations.
  - You can afford the higher administrative and support costs.
  - Isolation and application-specific configurations are crucial for your use case.

- **Choose Shared Topics if**:
  - You prioritize lower administrative and support costs.
  - Your applications can handle the complexity of filtering and processing mixed data.
  - Efficient resource utilization and simpler initial setup are more important.

In many cases, a hybrid approach can also be considered, where critical applications get dedicated topics for isolation and performance, while less critical applications share topics to optimize resource usage and reduce management complexity. This approach can balance the pros and cons of both options.
