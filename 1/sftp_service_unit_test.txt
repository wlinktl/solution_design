Sftp Service Unit Test

Setup:

We use MockitoExtension to enable Mockito annotations.
ReflectionTestUtils is used to inject configuration properties into the SFTPPGPService.
Mocking:

Mock JSch, Session, and ChannelSftp to simulate SFTP operations.
Mock PGP decryption method from PGPCryptoExample.
Tests:

testExecuteSFTPJob: Verifies that the SFTP job connects to the server, lists files, retrieves a file, and disconnects properly.
testDecryptFile: Ensures the decryption method reads the encrypted file, decrypts it using mocked PGP methods, and writes the decrypted file.
