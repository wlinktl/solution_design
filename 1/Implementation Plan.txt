Implementation Plan
Based on the Software Development Specification (SDS) provided, we'll create a Spring Boot application with the following steps:

Startup: Initialize the Spring Boot application.
Load Configuration: Load schedules and SFTP configurations from a configuration file.
Run Cron Job: Schedule a job to execute the SFTP process every 5 minutes using Spring Scheduler.
Connect to SFTP Server: Use SSH private key for authentication and connect to the SFTP server.
File Handling: Retrieve files from the SFTP server and save them to a specific directory.
Decrypt File: Decrypt the retrieved file using Bouncy Castle.
